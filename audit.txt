Database Auditing
AUDIT_TRAIL param:
None or false: disabled
OS: audit records write to OS's audit_trail, application log on windows or audit_file_dest param on unix.
DB: audit record write to data dictionary, sys.aud$. use views to see contents.
DB_EXTENDED: same as DB but include sql statement with bind variables that generate the audit record.
XML: same as os, but formatted in XML tag
XML_EXTENDED: as XML, with sql statements and bind variables

audit privileges:
audit create any trigger;
audit select any table by session;

By default audting generates ONE audit record for every session that violates an audit condition, irrespective of number of violations.
Same as appending BY SESSION to audit command. 
Append BY ACCESS instead generates one record for every violation.

auditing specific objects:
audit insert on ar.hz_parties whenver successful;
audit all on ar.ra_interface_lines_all;

By default, all operations successful or not are audited

audit login:
audit session whenever not successful;

views for sys.aud$, DB/DB_EXTENEDED param:
DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL,(DBA_AUDIT_OBJECT, DBA_AUDIT_STATEMENT, DBA_AUDIT_SESSION.) subset of DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL
commonly used cols:
OS_USERNAME, USERNAME, USERHOST, TIMESTAMP, OWNER, OBJ_NAME, ACTION_NAME, PRIV_USED, SQL_TEXT



Value-Based Auditing with TRIGGERS
Able to capture the values that were affected

eg.
create or replace trigger system.creditrating_audit
after update of creditrating
ON oe.customers
referencing new as new old as old
for each row
begin
if :old.creditrating != :new.creditrating THEN
insert into system.creditrating_audit
values (sys_context('userenv','os_user'), sys_context('userenv', 'ip_address'), 
:new.cust_id || ' credit rating changed from ' || :old.creditrating || ' to ' || :new.creditrating);
end if;
end;

Fine-Grained Audting (FGA)
FGA can be configured to generate audit records when certain rows are accessed or when certain columns of certain rows are accessed.
FGA package DBMS_FGA.

To create FGA audit policy: ADD_POLICY.
execute dbms_fga.add_policy(-
object_schema => 'HR',-
object_name => 'EMPLOYEES', -
policy_name => 'POL1', -
audit_condition => 'department_id=80', -
audit_column => 'SALARY');

query DBA_FGA_AUDIT_TRAIL to view audit.

** DBA_COMMON_AUDIT_TRAIL: shows audit from dba_audit_trail & dba_fga_audit_trail.

statistics only benefit SQL not PL/SQL.

object statistcs:
stats viewable in DBA_TABLES
include:
No. of rows
No. of blocks
Amount of free space in blocks that are used
Average length of rows
No. of chained rows - row in 2 or more blocks

stats for  Column of table in DBA_TAB_COLUMNS view.
include:
No. of distinct values
highest & lowest values
No. of nulls
Average column length.

stats on indexes, DBA_Indexes, include:
Depth of tree
No. of distinct values
clustering factor - how close the natural order of rows follows the order of keys

statistics store in data dictionary, optimizer use the statistics to make decision.

eg. analyze command:
analyze table regions compute statistics;
insert into regions values(99,'Birtish isles');
pg 475

eg. dbms_stats
exec dbms_stats.gather_table_stats('HR', 'REGIONS');
select num_rows from user_tables where table_name='regions';

view scheduler jobs:
select job_name from dba_scheduler_jobs;

instance statistics are accumulated in memory and flushed to automatic workload repository(AWR) by MMON
show paraneter statistics_level
Typical: stats needed by self-mgmt & tuning capabilities and will also enable automatic object analysis task that run daily.
Basic: disable computation of AWR stats and daily analysis.
All: gather all possible statistics, includes OS activity & detailed stats on sql statement execution. 
pg 508



Automatic workload repository
AWR exists as a set of tables and other objects in sysaux tablespace.

snapshots of stats in AWR are kept for 8 days, by default. (Configurable).
- able to have a historical picture of changes in database objects.

find invalid objects
select owner, object_name, object_type from dba_objects where status='INVALID';
repair invalid objects
alter object_type object_name COMPILE;
eg.
alter procedure hr.add_reg compile;
alter view rname compile;

if compile error:
desc dba_dependencies

recompile all objects:
@?/rdbms/admin/utlrp


unusable indexes
common causes: table moved(alter table... move) change physical placement of rows
instance param - SKIP_UNUSABLE_INDEXES, default true

find unusuable indexes:
select owner, index_name from dba_indexes where status='UNUSUABLE';

repair:
alter index index_name rebuild;

recommendations:
Hardware changes (such as adding CPUs)
Database Configuration (eg. instance param settings)
Schema Changes (eg. table & index partitioning)
Application changes (eg. using bid variables)

common cause: invalid data, format or constraint violation.
eg.
insert char into numeric field (oracle will auto typecast)

out of undo space
not enough temp space
user hit quota
insufficent privileges
**Use undo advisor, segment advisor, automatic database diagnostic monitor and alert mechanism


User Process Failure
